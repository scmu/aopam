# A Monadic Notation for Program Calculation

We propose a monadic notation for program calculation involving non-determinism,
in particular optimisation problems. The notation is not as concise as that in 
Algebra of Programming. However, we may use ordinary techniques such as proof
by induction to reason about programs. The only addition are monad laws and laws
regarding effect operators. The notation is more precise and lead to less confusion
than other pointwise notations that try to capture non-determinism.
